**HeartBeatID Monitor - Explore Your Heart Rate**

**HeartBeatID Monitor** empowers you to measure your heart rate directly from your iOS device using two innovative techniques:

**Measure Your Heart in Multiple Ways:**

* **PPG (Photoplethysmography):** Utilizes the back camera and flash to detect blood volume changes in your fingertip for precise heart rate readings.
* **rPPG (remote PPG):** Leverages the front camera to analyze color variations in your face, providing heart rate data without physical contact.

**Key Features:**

- **Dual-technique approach** for flexibility and accuracy in different scenarios.
- **Non-invasive and convenient** - no external sensors needed, just your device's cameras.
- **User-friendly interface** for effortless heart rate tracking and data visualization.
- **Open-source development** for transparency and community contributions.
- **Built with Apple's SDK libraries** for seamless integration and performance.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
2. **Open the project in Xcode.**
3. **Connect your iOS device and build the app** using your Apple developer account.

**Using the App:**

1. **PPG:** 
   - Place your fingertip over the back camera flash.
   - Tap "Start" to initiate measurement.
2. **rPPG:** 
   - Position your face within the front camera frame.
   - Tap "Start" to begin measurement.

**Technical Details:**

- Relies on **Apple's SDK libraries**, including AVFoundation, and Vision, for efficient image processing and analysis.
- Implements advanced algorithms for both PPG and rPPG signal extraction.
